# Description

This project is my first time series project. I did it to continue the recruitment process for a job as Data Scientist. I downloaded a dataset from Kaggle :
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/decide-soluciones/air-quality-madrid/data

The goal here is to predict the Air Quality in a station of Madrid. 

# Issues

As it was my first project on this theme, I had to explore the technic and algorithms specific to this tasks. I found ARIMA and some classic algorithms such as LSTM that I tried.
